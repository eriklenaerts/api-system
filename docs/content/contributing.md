## Community

!> **Todo:** Deze contributing guide is een copy/paste van ACPaaS UI. We moeten hier nog over nadenken en aanpassen.

ACPaaS UI is a community-driven project, where everyone is free to use and contribute. We would love for you to contribute too. Here are some tips to help you along.

### Be kind

Even if we don't explicitly mention it in every repo, we believe that empathy helps us make better tools. We have a code of conduct that reflects this.

### GitHub

Our repo's are found on GitHub, and generally, unless otherwise specified, we prefer GitHub Flow and Pull Requests as the way to receive contributions. Do check the contributing.md file in every repo for more details, or for exceptions to this rule.

If you're unsure of how to contribute, don't hesitate to ask on the #acpaas-ui-ngx or #acpaas-ui-react slack channel. You can easily join our DigAnt CafÃ© slack community here.

### Maintainers

ACPaaS UI consists of many different repo's, each with different maintainers. Check the maintainers page to find out who the maintainer is of any particular repo. The maintainer's job consists of:

Answering questions
Reviewing contributions
Fixing issues
Building features
To make the job of the maintainer easier, we like it when bugs and feature requests are reported as issues on the relevant repo.

> Be aware that asking for a feature is not the same as getting it. Sometimes a repo is not in active feature development, sometimes a maintainer has other work on their plate, sometimes it's just not the right feature for the problem at hand. Features with the label help-wanted are good opportunities for you to contribute.

### Roadmap

The direction of the different parts of ACPaaS UI is not always clear. To discuss roadmap and policy these are the best places:

Quick questions are best asked on the #acpaas-ui-ngx slack channel or #acpaas-ui-react slack channel.
Longer questions specific to a particular repo are best reported as issues on that repo.
Longer questions about ACPaaS UI in general can be reported as issues on the ACPaaS UI repo.
If we know something about the roadmap of a particular repo then it will be in the README of that repo. Any information on the overall direction of ACPaaS UI will be in the main ACPaaS UI README.
